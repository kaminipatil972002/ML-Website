        <h2>History and relationships to other fields</h2>
        <p>The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of
            computer gaming and artificial intelligence. The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time
            period.</p>
        <p>By the early 1960s an experimental "learning machine" with punched tape memory, called CyberTron, had been
            developed by Raytheon Company to analyze sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using
            rudimentary reinforcement learning. It was repetitively "trained" by a human operator/teacher to recognize
            patterns and equipped with a "goof" button to cause it to re-evaluate incorrect decisions. A representative
            book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing
            mostly
            with machine learning for pattern classification. Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the
            1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973.  In 1981 a report was given on using teaching
            strategies so
            that a neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from
            a
            computer terminal.</p>
        <p>Modern-day machine learning has two objectives, one is to classify data based on models which have been
            developed, the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models. A
            hypothetical
            algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in
            order to train it to classify the cancerous moles. A machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform
            the
            trader of future potential predictions.</p>

        <h2>How machine learning works</h2>
        <p> <a href="https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/blog/what-is-machine-learning/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley</a> (link resides
            outside IBM) breaks out the learning system of a machine learning algorithm into three main parts</p>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li> <b> A Decision Process:</b> In general, machine learning algorithms are used to make a prediction or
                classification.
                Based on some input data, which can be labeled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate
                about a
                pattern in the data.</li>
            <br>
            <li> <b>An Error Function:</b> An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If there are known
                examples, an
                error function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model.</li>
            <br>
            <li> <b>A Model Optimization Process:</b> If the model can fit better to the data points in the training
                set,
                then
                weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the model estimate. The
                algorithm will repeat this “evaluate and optimize” process, updating weights autonomously until a
                threshold
                of accuracy has been met. </li>

        <h2>Machine learning methods</h2>
        <p>Machine learning models fall into three primary categories.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Supervised machine learning </h3>
                <p> <a href="https://www.ibm.com/in-en/topics/supervised-learninga" target="_blank">Supervised learning </a> , also
                    known as
                    supervised machine learning, is defined by its use of labeled datasets to
                    train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the
                    model, the
                    model
                    adjusts its weights until it has been fitted appropriately. This occurs as part of the cross
                    validation
                    process
                    to ensure that the model avoids overfitting or underfitting. Supervised learning helps organizations
                    solve a
                    variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your
                    inbox. Some
                    methods used in supervised learning include neural networks, naïve bayes, linear regression,
                    logistic
                    regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM).

            <li>
                <h3>Unsupervised machine learning</h3>
                <p> <a href="https://www.ibm.com/in-en/topics/unsupervised-learning" target="_blank"> Unsupervised learning </a>, also
                    known as
                    unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze
                    and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without
                    the need
                    for
                    human intervention. This method's ability to discover similarities and differences in information
                    make it
                    ideal
                    for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image and
                    pattern
                    recognition. It's also used to reduce the number of features in a model through the process of
                    dimensionality
                    reduction. Principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are two common
                    approaches
                    for this. Other algorithms used in unsupervised learning include neural networks, k-means
                    clustering, and
                    probabilistic clustering methods.

                <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning" target="_blank"> Reinforcement machine learning</a>
                    is a
                    machine
                    learning model that is similar to supervised learning, but the
                    algorithm isn't trained using sample data. This model learns as it goes by using trial and error. A
                    sequence
                    of
                    successful outcomes will be reinforced to develop the best recommendation or policy for a given
                    problem.

                    The IBM Watson® system that won the Jeopardy! challenge in 2011 is a good example. The system used
                    reinforcement
                    learning to learn when to attempt an answer (or question, as it were), which square to select on the
                    board,
                    and

        <h2>Common machine learning algorithms</h2>
        <p>A number of machine learning algorithms are commonly used. These include:</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b> Neural networks:</b> Neural networks simulate the way the human brain works, with a huge number of
                linked
                processing nodes. Neural networks are good at recognizing patterns and play an important role in
                applications including natural language translation, image recognition, speech recognition, and image
                creation.</li>
            <br>
            <li> <b>Linear regression:</b>This algorithm is used to predict numerical values, based on a linear
                relationship
                between different values. For example, the technique could be used to predict house prices based on
                historical data for the area.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b> Logistic regression:</b> This supervised learning algorithm makes predictions for categorical
                response
                variables, such as“yes/no” answers to questions. It can be used for applications such as classifying
                spam
                and quality control on a production line.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Clustering:</b> Using unsupervised learning, clustering algorithms can identify patterns in data so
                that
                it can
                be grouped. Computers can help data scientists by identifying differences between data items that humans
                have overlooked.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Decision trees: </b>Decision trees can be used for both predicting numerical values (regression) and
                classifying
                data into categories. Decision trees use a branching sequence of linked decisions that can be
                represented
                with a tree diagram. One of the advantages of decision trees is that they are easy to validate and
                audit,
                unlike the black box of the neural network.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Random forests:</b> In a random forest, the machine learning algorithm predicts a value or category
                by
                combining
                the results from a number of decision trees.</li>

                automated machine learning</a> will be improved tools for labelling data and the automatic
            tuning of neural net architectures, said Michael Mazur, CEO of software company AI Clearing, which uses AI
            to
            improve construction reporting.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The need for labelled data created a labelling industry of human annotators based in low-cost countries
                like
                India, Central Eastern Europe and South America, Mazur said. The risks associated with using offshore
                labor
                "pushed the market to look at different ways of avoiding or minimizing this part of the process."
                Improvements in semi- and self-supervised learning are helping companies keep the amount of manually
                labelled data to a minimum.</li>
            <br>
            <li>By automating the work of selecting and tuning a neural network model, AI will become cheaper, and new
                solutions will take less time to reach market.

    <section id="Ethics">
        <h2>Ethics</h2>
        <p>Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions. Systems that are trained on datasets collected with
            biases
            may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices. For example, in
            1988, the UK's Commission for Racial Equality found that St. George's Medical School had been using a
            computer
            program trained from data of previous admissions staff and this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who
            were
            found to be either women or had non-European sounding names. Using job hiring data from a firm with racist
            hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by
            similarity to previous successful applicants. Responsible collection of data and documentation of
            algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning.
            <br>
            AI can be well-equipped to make decisions in technical fields, which rely heavily on data and historical
            information. These decisions rely on the objectivity and logical reasoning. Because human languages contain
            biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.
            <br>
            Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are seen in health care. There are
            concerns
            among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as
            income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing
            ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increase profits. For example, the algorithms could be
            designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary
            owners
            hold stakes. There is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional
            tool
            to diagnose, medicate, and plan recovery paths for patients, but this requires these biases to be mitigated.

    <section id="Limitations">
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to
            deliver
            expected results. Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the
            data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of
            resources,
            and evaluation problems.
            <br>
            In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.
            Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years
            of
            time and billions of dollars invested.
            <br>
            Machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and
            increased
            reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature. While it has improved with training sets, it
            has
            not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for
            the
            findings research themselves.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> <b>Bais</b>
                <p>Machine learning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning
                    system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new
                    customer
                    groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on human-made data, machine
                    learning
                    is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society. Language
                    models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases. Machine learning
                    systems used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people.
                    In 2015, Google photos would often tag black people as gorillas, and in 2018 this still was not
                    well resolved, but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the
                    training data, and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all. Similar issues with
                    recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems. In 2016, Microsoft tested a
                    chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language. Because of
                    such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other
                    domains. Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and
                    propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists,
                    including Fei-Fei Li, who reminds engineers that "There's nothing artificial about AI...It's
                    inspired by
                    people, it's created by people, and—most importantly—it impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are
                    only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility."</p>
            </li>
            <li> <b> Explainability</b>
                <p>Explainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), is artificial
                    intelligence (AI) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI. It
                    contrasts with the "black box" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain
                    why
                    an AI arrived at a specific decision. By refining the mental models of users of AI-powered systems
                    and
                    dismantling their misconceptions, XAI promises to help users perform more effectively. XAI may be an
                    implementation of the social right to explanation.</p>

            </li>
            <li> <b> Overfitting</b>
                <p>Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as
                    overfitting. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how
                    well it fits the data but penalizing the theory</p>
            </li>
            <li> <b> Other limitations and vulnerabilities</b>
                <p>Learners can also disappoint by "learning the wrong lesson". A toy example is that an image
                    classifier
                    trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are
                    likely
                    to be horses. A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often do not
                    primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they
                    learn
                    relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of
                    certain types of real objects. Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in
                    "adversarial" images that the system misclassifies.
                    <br>
                    Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations.
                    Some systems are so brittle that changing a single adversarial pixel predictably induces
                    misclassification.[citation needed] Machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation
                    and/or
                    evasion via adversarial machine learning.
                    <br>
                    Researchers have demonstrated how backdoors can be placed undetectably into classifying (e.g., for
                    categories "spam" and well-visible "not spam" of posts) machine learning models which are often
                    developed and/or trained by third parties. Parties can change the classification of any input,
                    including
                    in cases for which a type of data/software transparency is provided, possibly including white-box
                    access.
